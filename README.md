# SFACT-proc

Spectral processing codes for the Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) extragalactic survey.

WALF is, at its core, a Python wrapper for the automated line-fitting code ALFA (https://github.com/rwesson/ALFA).
It includes other functions (to be detailed later).

(Also to be detailed later - changes to ALFA made to accommodate higher redshift spectra)
